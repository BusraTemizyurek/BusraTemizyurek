# Hi there 👋

## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on a mobile app to analyze the performance of motorcycle riders. On this project, I'm using TypeScript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. I'm also solving LeetCode challenges to improve my data structures and algorithm skills.

💬 Ask me about my journey from Mining Engineering to software development and how I used Python to solve industry problems in my thesis.

⚡ Fun fact: I’ve been skating since I was 7, and I love a variety of activities like sailing, cycling, beach volleyball, and snowboarding. I also have a talent for mimicking voices and sounds, which makes for some fun impersonations! Whether it's making people laugh with a sudden joke or dancing to the rhythm of life, I always bring energy and creativity to whatever I do.
